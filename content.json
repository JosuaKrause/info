insights, is a challenging task. Often the importance of a feature in a model is only a rough estimate
condensed into one number. However, our research goes beyond these naïve estimates through the design
and implementation of an interactive visual analytics system, Prospector. By providing interactive
partial dependence diagnostics, data scientists can understand how features affect the prediction overall.
In addition, our support for localized inspection allows data scientists to understand how and why
specific datapoints are predicted as they are, as well as support for tweaking feature values and seeing
how the prediction responds. Our system is then evaluated using a case study involving a team of data
scientists improving predictive models for detecting the onset of diabetes from electronic medical records.",

transparency in machine learning models for experts to understand and trust their decisions.
To this end, we propose a visual analytics workflow to help data scientists and domain
experts explore, diagnose, and understand the decisions made by a binary classifier.
The approach leverages &ldquo;instance-level explanations&rdquo;, measures of local feature relevance
that explain single instances, and uses them to build a set of visual representations
that guide the users in their investigation. The workflow is based on three main visual
representations and steps: one based on aggregate statistics to see how data distributes
across correct / incorrect decisions; one based on explanations to understand which
features are used to make these decisions; and one based on raw data, to derive insights
on potential root causes for the observed patterns. The workflow is derived from a
long-term collaboration with a group of machine learning and healthcare professionals
who used our method to make sense of machine learning models they developed. The case
study from this collaboration demonstrates that the proposed workflow helps experts
derive useful knowledge about the model and the phenomena it describes, thus experts
can generate useful hypotheses on how a model can be improved.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there is growing consensus of the critical need to have better
techniques to explain machine learning models. However, many
of the popular techniques are instance-level explanations, which explain
the model from the point of view of a single data point. While
local explanations may be misleading, they are also not human-scale,
as it is impossible for users to read explanations for how the model
behaves on all of their data points. Our work-in-progress paper explores
the effectiveness of providing instance-level explanations in
aggregate, by demonstrating that such aggregated explanations have
a significant impact on users’ ability to detect biases in data. This is
achieved by comparing meaningful subsets, such as differences between
ground truth labels, predicted labels, and correct and incorrect
predictions, which provide necessary navigation to explain machine
learning models.",

      model explanations by providing examples of well-known ML models. Second,

      "abstract": "Many researchers across diverse disciplines aim to analyze the behavior of cohorts
whose behaviors are recorded in large event databases. However, extracting cohorts from databases is
a difficult yet important step, often overlooked in many analytical solutions. This is especially true
when researchers wish to restrict their cohorts to exhibit a particular temporal pattern of interest.
In order to fill this gap, we designed COQUITO, a visual interface that assists users defining cohorts
with temporal constraints. COQUITO was designed to be comprehensible to domain experts with no
preknowledge of database queries and also to encourage exploration. We then demonstrate the utility
of COQUITO via two case studies, involving medical and social media researchers.",
